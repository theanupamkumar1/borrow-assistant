# Borrowing Ledger Project Overview

## Project Description
The Borrowing Ledger is a natural language-powered system designed to manage financial transactions in a small business or personal setting. It allows users to input commands in natural language (Hindi, English, or Hinglish) to record borrowings, check balances, and perform basic financial calculations.

## Key Features
1. Natural language input processing (Hindi, English, Hinglish)
2. Speech-to-text capability (future enhancement)
3. Automatic intent classification
4. Entity extraction (amounts, names, items)
5. Basic financial operations (add entry, show balance, delete entry, calculations)
6. Local and cloud database synchronization
7. Offline functionality with online syncing

## Technology Stack
- **Primary Language**: Python
- **Natural Language Processing**: 
  - NLTK
  - Custom ML model (scikit-learn)
  - indic_transliteration for Hindi processing
- **Database**: 
  - SQLite (local storage)
  - MongoDB (cloud storage)
- **API Framework**: FastAPI
- **ORM**: SQLAlchemy
- **Data Validation**: Pydantic
- **Machine Learning**: scikit-learn
- **Version Control**: Git
- **Containerization**: Docker

## Core Components
1. **NLP Processor**: Handles natural language input, performs entity extraction.
2. **Intent Classifier**: ML model for classifying user intents.
3. **Query Generator**: Converts processed NLP output into database queries.
4. **Database Models**: Defines the structure for storing ledger entries.
5. **API Routes**: Handles HTTP requests for the ledger operations.
6. **Input Processing Pipeline**: Orchestrates the flow from user input to database operation.

## Intents
1. add_entry
2. show_balance
3. delete_entry
4. calculation
5. subtraction

## Implementation Steps
1. Set up project structure and environment
2. Implement basic NLP processing with NLTK
3. Develop intent classification model
4. Create database models and CRUD operations
5. Implement API routes
6. Develop input processing pipeline
7. Integrate speech recognition (future enhancement)
8. Implement offline mode and syncing mechanism
9. Containerize the application
10. Deploy to cloud platform

## Future Enhancements
1. Voice interface for hands-free operation
2. Mobile application for on-the-go access
3. Advanced reporting and analytics features
4. Multi-user support with authentication
5. Integration with other financial tools or APIs

## Testing Strategy
- Unit tests for individual components
- Integration tests for pipelines
- End-to-end tests for complete user scenarios
- Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) pipeline

## Deployment
- Docker containers for easy deployment and scaling
- Cloud hosting (e.g., AWS, Google Cloud, or DigitalOcean)
- Automated deployment using CI/CD tools

This project combines natural language processing, machine learning, and database management to create a user-friendly financial management tool. The focus is on creating a system that can understand and process natural language inputs effectively, making it accessible to users who may not be comfortable with traditional accounting software.
